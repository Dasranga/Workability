[[Afbeelding:Kaart lunetten utrecht.png|thumb|right|300|A map of Lunetten on Open Street Maps]]
'''Lunetten''' is a neighbourhood in the southeastern part of the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], that has approximately 12,000 inhabitants. It is mainly a residential area, since there is no significant industry present. Lunetten was constructed as an unban experiment mostly during the 1970s and 80s. It was desinged and planned by a combination of students of architecture and urban planning and the then forseen future inhabitants. The most striking result of this was the use of a ring-road with many circular bifurcations running back onto themselves or with dead ends. In Dutch this is called a ''Bloemkoolwijk'' (&quot;Cauliflower-neighborhood&quot;). This urban setup results in the whole neighborhood becomming like a single [[living street]], much like a distinct village within a city. 

Lunetten has a network of alleyways connecting the inner courtyards of the urban blocks. This creates a child-friendly neighborhood with many playing spots. There are also many sportsfacilities within and around Lunetten.

Lunetten is surrounded by major railroads and highways. To cope with the noise and pollution a giant park was created to surround and insulate the neighborhoud. Current infrastructural plans are however posing a threat to the park.

'''Lunetten''' is a neighbourhood in the southeastern part of the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], that has approximately 12,000 inhabitants. It is mainly a residential area, since there is no significant industry present. Lunetten was constructed as an urban experiment mostly during the 1970s and 80s. It was designed and planned by a combination of students of architecture and urban planning and the then foreseen future inhabitants. The most striking result of this was the use of a ring-road with many circular bifurcations running back onto themselves or with dead ends. In Dutch this is called a ''Bloemkoolwijk'' (&quot;Cauliflower-neighborhood&quot;). This urban setup results in the whole neighborhood becoming like a single [[living street]], much like a distinct village within a city. 

Lunetten has a network of alleyways connecting the inner courtyards of the urban blocks. This creates a child-friendly neighborhood with many playing spots. There are also many sportsfacilities within and around Lunetten.

Lunetten is surrounded by major railroads and highways. To cope with the noise and pollution a giant park was created to surround and insulate the neighborhoud. Current infrastructural plans are however posing a threat to the park.

'''Lunetten''' is a [[neighbourhood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lunetten|url=http://www.lunetten.nl/pub/index.php|publisher=lunetten.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the southeastern part of the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Reageer|title=Lezing over de Lunetten|url=http://www.dichtbij.nl/noord-kennemerland/regionaal-nieuws/artikel/2805930/lezing-over-de-lunetten.aspx|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=dichtbij.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; , that has approximately 12,000 inhabitants. It is mainly a [[residential area]], since there is no significant [[industry]] present. Lunetten was constructed as an urban experiment mostly during the 1970s and 80s. It was designed and planned by a combination of students of [[architecture]] and [[urban planning]] and the then foreseen future [[inhabitants]]. The most striking result of this was the use of a ring-road with many circular bifurcations running back onto themselves or with dead ends. In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] this is called a ''Bloemkoolwijk'' (&quot;Cauliflower-neighborhood&quot;). This [[urban]] setup results in the whole [[neighborhood]] becoming like a single [[living street]], much like a [[distinct]] [[village]] within a [[city]]. 

Lunetten has a [[network]] of alleyways connecting the inner courtyards of the urban blocks. This creates a child-friendly neighborhood with many playing spots. There are also many sports facilities within and around Lunetten.

Lunetten is surrounded by major [[railroads]] and [[highways]]. To cope with the noise and [[pollution]] a giant park was created to surround and insulate the neighborhoud. Current infrastructural plans are however posing a threat to the park.

==Curiosity ==
* Lunettes has the longest (140 meters) [[lightweight]] [[bridge]] in the [[world]] with a weight of 400 tonnes ([[Viaduct New Houtenseweg|Viaduct New Houtenseweg]]). This was constructed on the [[Rijksweg 27|A27]] on the [[weekend]] of 3 and 4 March 2012.

'''Lunetten''' is a [[neighbourhood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lunetten|url=http://www.lunetten.nl/pub/index.php|publisher=lunetten.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the southeastern part of the city of [[Utrecht]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Reageer|title=Lezing over de Lunetten|url=http://www.dichtbij.nl/noord-kennemerland/regionaal-nieuws/artikel/2805930/lezing-over-de-lunetten.aspx|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=dichtbij.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has approximately 12.000 inhabitants. It is mainly a [[residential area]], since there is no significant [[industry]] present. Lunetten was constructed as an urban experiment mostly during the 1970s and 80s. It was designed and planned by a combination of students of [[architecture]] and [[urban planning]] and the then foreseen future [[inhabitants]].{{cn|date=May 2013}} A result of this was the use of a ring-road with many circular bifurcations running back onto themselves or with dead ends. In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] this is called a ''Bloemkoolwijk'' (&quot;Cauliflower-neighborhood&quot;). This urban setup results in the whole neighbourhood becoming like a single [[living street]], much like a distinct village within a city.

Lunetten has a network of alleyways connecting the inner courtyards of the urban blocks. This creates a child-friendly neighborhood with many playing spots. There are also many sports facilities within and around Lunetten.

Lunetten is surrounded by major [[railroads]] and [[highways]]. To cope with the noise and [[pollution]] a giant park was created to surround and insulate the neighborhoud. Current infrastructural plans are however posing a threat to the park.{{cn|date=May 2013}}

Lunetten has the longest (140 meters) lightweight bridge in the world with a weight of 400 tonnes (Viaduct Nieuwe Houtenseweg).{{cn|date=May 2013}} This was constructed on the [[Rijksweg 27|A27]] on the weekend of 3 and 4 March 2012.
